# KS_Fantasy Website Project
*a fun fantasy football web project that will log and display both our main league's history, teams, stats, players, and more*

**Planning**

This website will be a one-stop shop for accessing data from the ESPN Redraft league and the Sleeper Dynasty league simulataneously. To start it should contain the following pages:
- Home Page (basic home page with some of the latest news and introduction)
- Sleeper History (comprehensive history and results of all previous Sleeper seasons)
- ESPN History (comprehensive history and results of all previous ESPN seasons)
- Scoreboard (shows the latest weekly matchups of both leagues)
- Standings (shows the current standings of both leagues)

After these are completed, some expansions could be made to make the website even more interactive. Some ways this could be possible are:
- Using Sleeper's publically available API found here: https://docs.sleeper.com/
- Using AI to generate team insights (could hard code at first and use an API after)
